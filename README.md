BCS: An algorithm that finds a solution to the BCS equation
Welcome to the BCS project! This repository hosts an algorithm designed to find a solution to the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) equation, a fundamental equation in the theory of superconductivity. Here, we provide a brief overview of the project along with instructions on how to use it and visualize its results.

Overview
The BCS equation describes the behavior of paired electrons in a superconductor, providing insights into various physical properties such as superconducting critical temperature, energy gap, and density of states. Our algorithm aims to solve this equation numerically, allowing researchers and enthusiasts to explore the behavior of superconducting systems under different conditions.

Usage
To use the BCS algorithm, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/BCS_algorithm.git
Install the required dependencies. You can find them listed in the requirements.txt file.

Run the main script, providing input parameters such as temperature, energy gap, and chemical potential.

Visualize the results using the provided plotting functions.

Example Usage
Here's a simple example of how to use the BCS algorithm:

python
Copy code
from bcs_solver import solve_bcs_equation
from bcs_plotter import plot_temperature_vs_gap, plot_temperature_vs_chemical_potential

# Solve the BCS equation
temperature_range = [1, 10, 100]  # Specify temperature range
delta_values = solve_bcs_equation(temperature_range)

# Plot temperature vs energy gap
plot_temperature_vs_gap(temperature_range, delta_values)

# Plot temperature vs chemical potential
plot_temperature_vs_chemical_potential(temperature_range, chemical_potential_values)
Results
Below are two sample plots showcasing the relationship between temperature and:
